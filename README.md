#EVER LOVELY JEWEL
Ever Lovely Jewel, a visionary project that goes beyond your usual expectations of a jewelry store. At Ever Lovel Jewel, this is more than just a shop. It is an immersive experience crafted by our people, who has passion for extraordinary craftmanship and dedication to telling stories through our work. 

Our project is made with the thought in mind that jewelry is not just an accessory, it is a way to express yourself, your uniqueness and your stories. Join us and let us be the narrator of your moments. 

#Design Process
While making this website, I thought of making it tailored for teens and young adults as there is an ongoing jewelry trend among them. This website would then be catered to them as it would be a website where they search for items to express themselves better. 

I am aware that my target audience would love a visually pleasing and interactive website where they would enjoy browing through. I am also aware that they would want to see the latest trendy jewelry releases, as they would want to keep up with the fashion trends. 

Therefore, my project of Ever Lovely Jewel is a great way to help them achieve these as my website caters to all such needs. For instance, I incorporated sage green as the predominant color in the design of my website. This particular shade of green aligns with contemporary trends and is widely regarded as an visually appealing color,hence resonating well with my target audiences. 
It also meets my user needs as I have made my website responsive. This would allow many different users with different devices to be able to browse and shop on my website smoothly. 

While making the website, I tried to think in the shoes of my target audience.
I know that as a potential customer, I would want to be able to navigate around the website easily such that I am able to find exactly what I am looking for with ease. 
I know that as a potential customer, I want easily accessible customer support options like contact forms, so that I can quickly resolve any queries or concerns. 
I also know that as a potential customer, I want to be able to find reviews on Ever Lovely Jewel, such that I am able to trust it and know that its product is of high quality and is reliable.

All these user scenarios I thought of when designing my website is what makes my website the best way to help my target audience achieve these things. I will explain more below as those are part of features of my website.
